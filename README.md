Test Repository for practicing Git Commands

01/01/2022:  
I did the *"Git and GitHub Tutorial - Version Control for Beginners"*, by **FreeCodeCamp**  
Available in: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/

02/01/2022:  
I lost my first README.md file forcing a *push*.

03/01/2022:  
I made a *pull* to edit my README.md locally. Then I managed to *push* the modified file.

04/01/2022:  
Minor text fixes.
